<p>Pizza</p>
<p><img src="pizza.png" style="width:170px; height:170px; margin-left: 15px; float: right;">
Modern pizza evolved from ancient flatbreads topped with herbs and oils, which were dietary staples for the Greeks,
Romans, and Egyptians. However, the city of Naples, Italy, is recognized as its official birthplace, where it emerged as
a quick, affordable street food for the working class in the 18th century. The addition of tomatoes in the late 1700s
marked a turning point, transforming simple flatbread into the dish we recognize today. A famous, though sometimes
debated, legend from 1889 credits pizza maker Raffaele Esposito with creating the Margherita pizza—featuring red
tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil to represent the Italian flag—in honor of Queen Margherita of Savoy. From
Naples, the dish spread globally via Italian immigrants, eventually becoming one of the most popular foods in the world.</p>
